                    <p>
                        Invented in 1895, by a man named William G. Morgan. He founded this sport as he found the new sport of basketball too
                        vigorous. However, when he frist founded this sport, he named it Mintonette due to its similarities to badminton. This 
                        was later changed as the previous name was confusing and not descriptive enough. It grew exponentially in the US due 
                        to its wide appeal to both sexes, armed forces and many other organisations. The first nationwide tournament was held
                        in New York City in 1922. This was also after WW1, whereby American troops introduced the sport to fellow European troops.

                    <p>
                        2 teams of 6 are separated by a tall net. The objective of each team is to get the ball to hit the ground in the opponent's
                        court. However, players are not allowed to hold or catch the ball. Players can only touch the ball for less than a second and
                        can only touch the ball once if it's on their side of their court. Each team is allowed 3 touches before they have to try to 
                        score. Players are not allowed at any time to touch the net or go into the other player's court.

                    <h2>Sudden spike in popularity</h2>
                    <p>
                        In Japan, volleyball recruitment rates were dropping. All of a sudden, there was a huge spike in volleyball application rates
                        in schools. This was due to a certain anime called Haikyuu!! The anime is about a boy who joins an infamous high school 
                        volleyball team that were famous at one point but have now fallen from their high position. Now, he's on the same team with 
                        one of his rivals. Togther, they aim to become the best team in Japan. The anime is real enough that even top volleyball
                        athletes have said that most of what happens is realistic and similar to competitive volleyball matches.
