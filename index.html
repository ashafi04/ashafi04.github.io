                    <h2>Introduction to sports</h2>
                    <p>
                        Currently in the 21st century, sports has many forms. Some are on land like ball sports such as basketball and volleyball. While
                        others are on water like sailboating or even in the air like skydiving. Usually, sports require the use of energy or the user/player
                        is doing something physical although there are probably some outliers such as Esports. Sports is essentially a game whereby an individual
                        or a team works towards the goal of winning, invoking the spirit of competitiveness.

                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>
                        This will briefly explain the history of sports. The oldest sport to have existed is wrestling. This is normally when 2 people try
                        to force the other out of a certain area and the last person inside it is the winner. This is supported by evidence of cave paintings
                        dating back 15,300 YEARS. Eventually, it evolved to have different variations however, in the past, it was mainly used as a way to train
                        hunters or prepare people for war. This explains why most older sports involve sparring or throwing of weapons.

                    <h2>Popular Sports</h2>
                    <p>
                        While there are tons of sports to be discussed, some outshine others and are watched by millions all over the world, others are played locally
                        and are barely known outside of its local region. One example of the former is football/soccer. This is a sport whereby 2 teams of 11 try to get
                        a ball into a net on the opponent's side of the field. This sport is renowned worldwide and almost each separate country has its own football
                        league. Every 4 years, the best few teams fight it out to prove who is the best team in the world. While it is just a sport, there are a few 
                        reasons forits popularity. Some of them include the team rivalries that have gone on for generations and the passion of any football fan, 
                        whether they play the game or not.
