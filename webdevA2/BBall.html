                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>
                        The sport was created by a man named James Naismith. This was supposed to be a less injury-prone sport compared to football. It
                        was also a way to keep athletes indoors during winter seasons. He had the intent of making a simple to understand game while also
                        making it complex to be interesting.The first game turned out to be an all out brawl. All the boys resulted in physical violence,
                        many injured with 1 blacking out and another had a dislocated shoulder. Due to this, Naismith wanted to stop them from playing again
                        in fear of worse results. However, the players were relentlessly asking him whether they could play again. Thus, he made up more
                        rules that led to the basketball we know and love today.

                            <h2>How to play</h2>
                            <p>
                                In this sport, 2 teams of 5 try to get a ball into the net of a hoop on the opponen's side of the court. Points can be earned
                                through increments of 1,2 or 3. This is based on how far the player scores away from the hoop. A player can only move with the
                                ball when he bounces the ball. Each player has their own specialisation such as the shooting guard is better at scoring further
                                from the hoop, acquiring 3 points each time they score. Another position is the center. This is arguably the most tiring role to
                                play in the game. This is due to the fact that the center's job is to stay under the hoop and get the ball if anybody on his team
                                were to miss. They are required to constantly run up and down the court and also jump high to get the ball first.

                            <p>
                                The most popular basketball league is definitely the NBA. NBA stands for National Basketball Association. The NBA was established 
                                in 1949 after the merger of two rival organisations, the National Basketball League and the Basketball Association of America.This 
                                league is only held in the US but also features foreign talent such as Joel Embiid and Jamal Murray. The NBA also features current 
                                and past superstars such as Stephen Curry, Shaquille O' Neil and the late Kobe Bryant.
